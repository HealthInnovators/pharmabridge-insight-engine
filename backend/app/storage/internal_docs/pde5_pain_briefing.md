# PDE5 inhibitors in pain indications (demo)

This briefing captures a lightweight view of PDE5 inhibitors (including sildenafil) and possible relevance to pain pathways.

## Key points
- Mechanistic plausibility: NO/cGMP signaling in nociceptive processing.
- Translational gap: preclinical-to-clinical evidence is weak.
- Suggested next steps: identify preclinical models and any pilot trials.
